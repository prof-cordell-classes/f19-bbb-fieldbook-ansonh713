# Reflective: Binding

### Design in Content
A major theme that came up in discussion this week that I think deserves more development is the use of design elements like binding and presentation to send messages about the book, whether or not those are in alignment with the content of the book itself. We discussed how Lindsay Schmittle was able to execute a project with a unified design vision that supplemented the content of her book, and conversely, how shiny new editions of the Percy Jackson series have clashed with the secretive tone of the narrator. One in-class example that I think also really fit well with this train of thought is the Fiapo book from Ricardo Dantas. During the process of making that book, Dantas made very deliberate design choices that would match the narrative that he was trying to tell. He chose light but thick paper to add to a sense of delicateness to the book, and used lay-flat binding in order to give the pages the strongest sense of continuity. On the other hand, he did make some choices that were utilitarian instead; for example, he used Garamond as the font because that was the only font they had that left a clear impression on the paper and was reasonably stocked with letters. That brings me to an important note: because design is orthogonal to the writing process, not all design choices enhance or hinder the text. Some choices are made without the writing in mind, which is important for book designers because it establishes design as a separate consideration that doesn't rely entirely on the text to make its decisions.  

### Design in Context

Along that line of thought, something that I want to consider is the use of design to send messages outside of the content of the text. For example, my public library once had a display shelf (it might still be there...) where, similar to how Penguin has that classic cover format, each book was bound identically, with only the title and author showing any distinction between the books. Each book cover and spine was a monotone, unremarkable, beige-ish gray; I remember I only approached the shelf in the first place because I was looking for classic, "grown-up" books, but I didn't recognize any of the authors or titles. The display theme? Books written throughout history by women authors, largely overlooked, forgotten, or underrepresented. The dull packaging in this case was a clear and conscious decision on the part of the book publisher, as a representation of the context behind the book, rather than the content of the book. I think that's another interesting use of design to serve a purpose, though I do have some concerns about its effectiveness (I'll get to that later on here).

### Design in Culture

The third category of design purpose that I want to bring up is irrelevant to the book itself, because these design choices are made in relation to things besides the book. Chesnutt's short story "Baxter's Procustes" shows (at least in theory) that books can be made without a single ounce of consideration for their contents, considering Baxter's book was entirely blank. The book's format is arguably not a result of context either, since it wasn't made to say anything about Baxter or the circumstances of the book's creation. Instead, the book's use of paper, binding, and sealing practices were a direct response to the culture around it; Baxter created a finely-crafted book that would appeal to the tastes of the Bodleian Club. That sort of messaging says the most about the society around the published book rather than anything about the book itself. In a less fictional example, I came across this short Twitter thread the other day from Ethan M. Aldridge, an author/illustrator whose work I enjoy quite a bit.

Aldridge's notes on what he sees in publishing as a trend toward special edition physical books and visually eye-catching/tactile experiences is really interesting because he also frames it as a pushback against the flat and digital nature of ebooks. That's not about the content or the background of a text; that's a specific response to the culture that spawned the book. Design choices like that enter a sort of cultural dialogue, shaping the design of future books and becoming an entirely separate property from the text.

### Conclusion

So, recognizing these three entirely separate categories of how book binding and design can send messages that are sometimes interrelated with the text, the issue arises: how do we tell them apart? And I think the unfortunate answer is that we can't - at least not on first glance. I went looking at my library's interesting collection of women-authored books because the covers made me think they were part of a more conventional classics collection. I was using the covers as a cultural design choice when they were really a contextual design choice. Similarly, we were talking in class about how the design of newer editions of Percy Jackson detracted from the text's message, but it might have been more fitting to talk about the pros and cons of having a culture-oriented design (like Aldridge mentions, fancy new editions are part of publishing culture) versus having a content-oriented design that might be more in line with the tone of the text. I have brought it up before in discussion or in a previous reflective post, but I definitely hold the stance that there is no such thing as truly neutral design. I don't think there is a way to completely suppress sending any one of these three design messages, which means it's up to authors, editors, designers, publishers, and whoever else is behind the production of a book to make informed design decisions.
