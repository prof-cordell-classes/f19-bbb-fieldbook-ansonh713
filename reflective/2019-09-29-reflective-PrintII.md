# Reflective: Print II

#### Anson Huang

The first idea that I want to engage with is the "laws of typography" that Ellen Lupton's _Thinking With Type_ sets out for the reader. Lupton notes various "type crimes" often throughout the book, detailing typography faux pas that any budding designer should avoid. Some of them I agree with, for example, this alignment that shaped the text in a distracting way:

![Type Crime: The right edge of this left-aligned text forms a weird wedge.](/images/Lupton_Crime1.png)  

Others, not so much. For example, a set of signs that Lupton rails against for having an incorrect use of straight hatch marks versus curly apostrophes or quotations:

![Type Crime: The apostrophes in "Eva's" or "L'Occitane" have been replaced by hatch marks.](/images/Lupton_Crime2.png)

In my opinion, the difference here is minuscule and Lupton's complaint is unreasonably picky. However, during discussion, someone who had taken typography courses brought up that those rules are taught because breaking them is eye-catching, so established designers can break the rules to make a statement or draw attention. In essence, these rules are made to be broken. This is a fair point that I hadn't considered, but I'm not fully convinced. First, I would hardly call some of these "type crimes" eye-catching, especially with something like in my second example, where a single character has been changed and the text is still fully readable. I don't think most New Yorkers would give the sign's mistake a second glance. Second, even for more valid complaints, I worry about the messages Lupton sends with her wording. Of course, I understand that she is likely dramatizing the importance when she calls it a crime. But the language has potential to be stifling to young creators that are using the book as a guide. If a new typographer sees all these "crimes" and internalizes those rules as absolute law, we might be losing some creative innovation. Baskerville, too, was accused of casting letters so narrow that readers would go blind (Lupton, p. 17), but look where we are today. Artistic conventions should not be treated as law, and I think Lupton might be overstepping a bit when she criminalizes design choices that might just be different from the norm.  

One more interesting topic that came up in discussion that I'm still mulling over is where the "personality" of fonts comes from. Why are some fonts fun and flirty, others loud and brash, while others still are proper and elegant?

I think it must be, at least in part, our past associations. Consider fonts that look "techy" or "pixely" - these sorts of fonts that were popular on early digital displays are now only regularly seen on microwaves and train station info boards, but if you put it in a modern context, the style suddenly seems retro-digital. I don't need to analyze the stroke width or shape of DS-Digital (shown below) to know that I will forever associate it with alarm clocks, or maybe ticking bombs in action movies.

On the other hand, I think that there is some inherent character to most fonts. It's natural that slab-serif fonts like Rockwell seem loud and disruptive, when they take up so much visible space in our eyes and are near impossible to miss. Geometric shapes and fixed widths make fonts like Futura unmistakably modern with stability from its even strokes.  

I think Didot is a good example in illustrating how those two elements can come together. Didot's thin lines and serifs are fragile, like I might snap one in half, which lends it a more delicate flavor. Yet, the thicker strokes which come in exacting lines and circular curves give the letters more body and weight; and when combined in forms that alternate thick and thin in a way that reminds me of calligraphy, Didot feels elegant and stately, but with a modesty that fancy script fonts lack.
