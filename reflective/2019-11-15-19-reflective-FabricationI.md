# Reflective: Fabrication I

#### Anson Huang 

This week's discussions and readings have me thinking about the role of non-book objects and how closely those can be attached to their associated books before we leave the realm of bookhood. This is a particularly salient topic of discussion to me as I progress on my semester book project, a combination of 3-D printing and letterpress. My 3-D printed template is going to be used in conjunction with traditional letterpress typesetting, resulting in a printed page. Those pages are easily separable from the technology that made them, resulting in a finished project that closely resembles traditional books (inked text on a page, though unbound and with some art). This separation from product and technology is also visible in the example of MashBOT, which we looked at this week. MashBOT prints its stories as a strip of paper, which can be removed from the machine and AI that create them. In both of these examples, the made objects that contributed to the book's creation are invisible in the final product - the innovation is invisible unless you understand the process as well. For projects like these, the maker's book is standalone, and can be evaluated as a book or not a book based on the content alone.

At the other end of the spectrum, we have transformative technologies that turn books into unrecognizable non-book objects, which causes us to consider the role of an object's history as we decide whether or not it is a book. For example, look at Agrippa, which, when read on a computer, destroys its own text, leaving the shell of a book: a floppy disk. In a more analog made-object sense, we can consider book art like this:

![Book art with pages cut to from a tree](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/emma-taylor-8.jpg)

which destroys the original text and creates a new piece of art that is independent of the written word it was made from. Finally, we can look at Loss Sets, another example from this week's discussions. While discussing this week's readings with Stephanie and Gwen, we talked about this series of sculptures, which are derived by manipulating the words of a poem into 3-D coordinates, transforming them with latitude and longitude numbers, and using those resulting points to carve a small cube with geometric-looking spiderweb or coral patterns. We all agreed that the poems were unrecognizable in the final sculpture, and there was no way to 'read' the shapes to understand the themes of loss the creator was trying to convey. In these cases, the object started out with booklike qualities, and the technology that altered it removed those qualities, so the debate over whether these objects continue to have book status is based on what they used to be and how much of that former character they have retained.

Finally, and potentially the most interesting, are the made objects that sit on the border between book and non-book, because they incorporate strong and recognizable book elements while combining them with the world in new ways. For example, the 3-D printed mask of Lincoln and its corresponding museum exhibit have the written language and sharing of information that are commonly associated with books, with the use of space and 3-D objects being the major differences. The article from Kendra Pierre-Louis also highlights an example: a "book", 3-D printed, where each page is a relief image. On paper, this would be an artbook. Having this 3-D printed, with the many technological additions that go into such a project, the book becomes something else, or maybe something more. Does the new format make it less of a book and more of an object, or is it straddling both? I believe it must be the latter, which has strong implications for the future of books; if a book can incorporate non-book objects with future technologies to make something new without losing the qualities that make it a book, then books could be doing many more things in the future beyond what they already do for literacy, community, and cultural dialogues.
