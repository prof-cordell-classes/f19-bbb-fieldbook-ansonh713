# Reading Prep: Print I

#### Anson Huang

## Questions or Observations

1. Why has letterpress printing made its comeback as vintage and not any other forms of print? Why, for example, did cuneiform tablets or unbound parchment folios not find a resurgence in the digital age?
2. Is the value of letterpress printing in the modern day fundamentally different from its value at conception? Has anything been lost or gained?
3. I think it's interesting how aesthetics and the printing process interplay with each other. For example, minimalism and blank space are much more popular in the digital age. I'm sure a printer using Gutenberg's press would have loved to set fewer letters, but with the expense of paper at the time, it would have been unthinkable to not use as much of the page as was reasonably possible. Now that paper is sold five dollars a ream, that has become much more feasible, showing that the printing process can facilitate aesthetics. But considering the modern fascination with physicality and tactile printing, technology has advanced to facilitate the printing process.
