# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

## Questions or Observations

1. One of the running themes I noticed in these readings is the usage (and limitations) of written language. Carrión's piece visualizes an artform where we no longer need the written word to transmit meanings: *"A writer of the new art writes very little or does not write at all."* On the other hand, Daniel Maidman's essay on *The Humument* contends that words are the base form of concepts, and that other means of representation are often clunky: *"I have a deep-seated problem with conceptual art, which is this: if it is indeed a concept, why not express that concept in the native language of concepts, the mighty word?"* Comparing with other forms of books that we have seen, what are words good for and where do they fall short?

2. In the Wired article, I was interested by this author's statement on email lists as books: *"Folks like Ben Thompson are effectively writing books. Take a year of his essays, edit them for brevity and clarity, and you’d have a brilliant edition of This Year in Tech."* I personally agreed that it would constitute a book, but it raises the question: what separates an email from a book? Is collecting six months' worth of emails enough for a book? A month? A week? Is there a length requirement, or is the simple act of collection enough to create a book?

3. What is the role of the reader in a book's state of being? The book Phillips does his work in, *A Human Document*, is described in one essay as *"a functionally dead text, a book nobody remembers or reads anymore. The current lies latent on its pages, plaintively requesting a reader, but no reader makes himself available."* If a book needs a reader to be alive, then what should we make of the Future Library, where some great authors' works lie with no readers because they have no physical access? Are these texts dead before they've ever been exposed to the world?
