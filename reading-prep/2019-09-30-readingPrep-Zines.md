# Reading Prep: Zines

## Questions or Observations

1. I found the tone of the New York Times "Why the Internet Didn't Kill Zines" article frustrating, but interesting to analyze. Wortham writes about social media and zines as if they're diametrically opposed, with zines as a virtuous expression of humanity and social media as a faceless platform. This is especially apparent to me in the closing paragraph:  
 
_And it perhaps reflects why zines can feel so much more intimate than a Facebook post. The deliberation and care that goes into making them is important. The internet is especially adept at compressing humanity and making it easy to forget there are people behind tweets, posts and memes._  

I'm reminded of how we discussed that every time a new technology arises, it is regarded as numbing and shallow, while the old technology is raised up as more engaging and better for humanity. I feel like that pattern has repeated here, whether or not zines are actually better than social media.

2. I enjoyed how personal and wacky Pagan's zine was allowed to get because it was self-made; it reminded me of the catharsis that keeping a journal or diary might give. When she talks about having as many personalities as she wants for the zine, I think of how modern content creators like vloggers tend to 'curate' their lives to show the most interesting parts, like Pagan does, but unlike Pagan, they stick to one specific personal brand, which may be something new that has cropped up in the digital age.  

3. I had a really hard time attempting to navigate _Traces_ on my phone, but when I switched to laptop, I was struck by how much more fitting it was to browse the zine on a laptop screen, just because the horizontal shape made it possible to look at two pages at a time. Even though the zine is clearly meant for digital reading (based on the animated sections and interactive design), the two-page booklike spread makes for some easier reading, in my opinion.
