## Questions or Observations

1. I was interested by what Lupton calls "type crimes," typographical no-nos that go against the rules or don't look good. Some of them I agreed looked worse, but some of them I actually didn't mind, for example the hatch marks vs. apostrophes distinction or the closely spaced letters. What are Lupton's goals when she makes these rules? What messages does she send about typography, and values is she trying to uphold?
2. Pablo Medina's Bushwick typeface is an impressive expression of cultural identity. It's easy to see traditional fonts we use as sort of blank slates, but from _Thinking with Type_ and prior readings we know that those fonts were also expressions of identity on conception; gothic vs. humanist, changing serif size, designing stylized italics, these all supported a typographer's specific creative vision.
3. The font I chose to research this week is [Fit](https://djr.com/fit/), by David Jonathan Ross. I don't like how unreadable it is, but I did think on first glance about its potential applications for logos or branding, just because it is so distinctive while visibly filling the space. The creator does note this himself, with the tagline "Difficult to read, but impossible to miss". It does make me wonder, though, from the _Thinking with Type_ reading, which explains that logotypes are used to stylize a brand; if Fit was made on its own without the aim of being for a specific brand, does it still count as a logotype?
