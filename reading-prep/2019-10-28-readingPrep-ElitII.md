# Reading Prep: E-lit II

#### Anson Huang

## Questions or Observations

1. What is the appeal of The Deletionist's style of "writing", or rather, erasing? I noticed while using it that it had certain patterns, like keeping words that started with the same letter. Does the algorithmic nature of the tool add to or detract from the resulting poetry?

2. Flores' characterization of second- and third-generation e-literature was a really interesting lens to view e-lit through, but I wonder about the complexities of that categorization. For example, *With Those We Love Alive* takes place on an established third-generation platform, Twine, but the style itself seems to be much more in the literary tradition, which is more characteristic of a second-generation platform. How should we categorize such works?

3. *Fa√ßade*, from the Electronic Literature Collection volume 2, is a game that progresses based on the player's freeform input, searching for keywords and grammar to understand their intention rather than picking from preset options, like a choose-your-own-adventure book might. Where does e-lit end and where do video games (or other media: videos, movies) begin? Are all games considered e-literature?
