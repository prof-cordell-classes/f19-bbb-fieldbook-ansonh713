# Reading Prep: E-lit I

## Questions or Observations

1. Ferris Jabr's article on print and digital reading explicitly compares reading the same texts on paper vs. on a screen, with paper coming out on top for reading comprehension. Are there other factors we might want to compare that show the affordances of digital reading, like accessibility, ease of use, etc.?

2. How does Bois's use of multimedia (Youtube videos, interactive scrolling, Google Maps) affect the experience of reading it? Could this story be told the same way if you printed it out? Do any themes of the story have a stronger impact because of the format?

3. One of the affordances of print reading, according to Jabr, is the ability to physically sense where in the text you are, and to skip ahead or reread parts. Bois makes 17776 much more linear, since a link has to be clicked to progress to the next page, and there is no built-in back button. Does this linearity detract from the reading?
