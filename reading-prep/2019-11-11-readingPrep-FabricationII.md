## Questions or Observations

1. Some of the projects in Bibliocircuitry create alterity relations in technology by exposing the wires and showing off the technology that helped to build their works; is this possible for wireless technologies as well? Can we make invisible communication like wifi a tangible presence and what might that look like?  

2. Smith-Welch argues that experiencing alterity relations in technology (that is, where the medium interferes with the message and draws attention on its own) is critical to achieving technological fluency (that is, the ability to be creative with a technology). But is that actually true? I would think it takes technological fluency to be able to create an alterity work in the first place, so where did that fluency come from when book alterities didn't exist?  

3. In the chapter "Thinking as Handwork," Resch et al. suggest that museums should be wary of portraying 3-D printing as a purely positive tool to further their collections, because it may align them with the technology's manufacturers. I understand their point, but can we elaborate on why, exactly, this is a problem? Does 3-D printing in exhibits have cons, and what are they? What statements about technology do museums have the power to make, and are they ever allowed to overlap with industrial interests?
